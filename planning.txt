General Idea
You are a fisherman living in a home by the docks. There’s a store nearby that you can walk to and you sell your fish there. You’re able to buy better fishing gear and deposit your money in the bank. Every day is a new opportunity to collect fish.


GOALS
- Save/Load capabilities
- Create a bank
- Have the shopkeeper sell bait that lets you have a chance at double the fish
- Make a tavern where you can bet money
- Make it so it has to be past 8 to go to sleep
