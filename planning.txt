General Idea
You are a fisherman living in a home by the docks. There’s a store nearby that you can walk to and you sell your fish there. You’re able to buy better fishing gear and deposit your money in the bank. Every day is a new opportunity to collect fish.



Collection Specifics
Able to view how many fish you have on you or how many fish you’ve collected. Weight is random, etc.



GOALS
- Create a fish class that, when a new fish is created, randomizes the weight, color and kind of fish.
- Create a collection class that has every type of fish listed and which ones you've caught
- Create an inventory action that lets you view the fish you currently have
- Make it so you can sell fish to shopkeep
- Have $ on screen at all times
- Have time on screen at all times
